## Table of Design Patterns

* [Behavioral](#behavioral)
* [Creational](#creational)
* [Structural](#structural)

Behavioral
==========

>In software engineering, behavioral design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this comunication.

Creational
==========

>In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patters that deal with object creation mechanism, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the sotuation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

Structural
==========

>In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.
